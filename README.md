# Price-Scraper
Web scraper that compares prices of G2A and Steam games

 Functionality is there so I am happy to move on for the time being. Give it a go! It is a good demo of Jsoup in my opinion as well which
 I have had loads of fun developing with. I made the project for the steam summer sale to quickly search on my second monitor for the
 games across stores and it does just that. If you're looking for a UI experience then you're in for a bad time but it's perfect for me!
